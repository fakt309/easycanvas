# easycanvas

## Very easy way to draw

Just add a simple object and the library will draw it (for example: "circle", "triangle", "rectangle", "shape", "text", "image").  

*{ type: "image", x: 200, y: 200, src: "2.png"}*  
*{ type: "text", value: "Hello, world!", x: 200, y: 200, size: 26,font: "url(ShareTechMono.ttf)",fill: "#ff0000" }*

## You can load images and fonts very easily, just provide the url.

*src: "2.png"*  
*font: "url(ShareTechMono.ttf)",*
